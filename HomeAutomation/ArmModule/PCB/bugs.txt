RESET may need a 5k pullup resistor - an additional 10k is just barely enough

Add a header connection for reset
Add a header connection for 24VDC

Rs should be about 5ohms
Rs needs to be much beefier
fuse needs to be bigger - maybe 1amp polyfuse

Re XBee S2C: Poor power supply can lead to poor radio performance, especially if the supply voltage is not kept within
tolerance or is excessively noisy. To help reduce noise, we recommend placing both a 1uF and 8.2pF capacitor as
near to (pad 2/SMT, pin 1/TH) on the PCB as possible. If using a switching regulator for your power supply,
switching frequencies above 500kHz are preferred. Power supply ripple should be limited to a maximum 50mV
peak to peak.
