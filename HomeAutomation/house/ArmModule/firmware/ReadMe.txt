The FreeRTOS Labs download currently contains the FreeRTOS+TCP and FreeRTOS+FAT
source code, along with a set of examples that target various hardware and
development tools.

Note:  The Windows demo can be used with free tools, and without the need for
any specific hardware - however it will not provide true real time behaviour, or
representative network throughput.

See:

The directory structure of the official FreeRTOS download is used, even though
currently these products are provided in a separate Labs download.  This allow
the projects to be seamlessly moved from one download to the other, but can seem
strange when the files are viewed in isolation.
